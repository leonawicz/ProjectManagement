# Project Management

## Related items
Currently there is only this unpackaged **R** script and accompanying code for a projects hierarchy diagram.
No additional related items are available at this time, but those referenced above will eventually be included.

### Files and Data
This project does not use any data. `sankey.R` is used to produce of project hierarchy diagram of my current projects.

### Code flow
The Sankey diagram has become part of project management.
Each project has its own, detailing the relationships among **R** code and data relevant to the project,
and in some cases, how they relate to code and data files which are more general and span multiple projects.
This diagram will be available for this project once more project code has been developed.
